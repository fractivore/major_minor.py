program: major_minor.py
author: Nick Henry
Usage:
      1. Ensure the song you wish to convert is in wav format and you have python installed.
      2. Move the song into the directory containing this file and scale_mode_transpositions.json
      3. Type: sudo python major_minor.py --file YOUR_FILENAME_WITH_EXTENSION.wav
        (sudo is needed due to the scipy wav write library)
      4. Follow the prompts. Use all lowercase letters and denote the key letter using e.g. a# instead of bb.
        (I have not added input verification yet)
      5. Wait for the program to complete and then bask in the dulcet tones generated by this conversion!
